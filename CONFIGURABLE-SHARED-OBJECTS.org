#+TITLE: Configurable Shared Objecs - .dll, .so files

* External Libaries the right way.

I modified the external library code i cl-sqlite to allow the user to customize the location of the external library.
First I created the config system to include a macro to override the default seach behaviour.
Next I modified sqlite-ffi to override the complexities of its prexisting define-foreign-library and in the override case use the config define-foreign-library location.
I added config to asd and made the primary system depend on the config.

The model I used in that of CL+SSL.
